General Info
This project is Hadoop Mini Project that uses Map reduce to get the number of accidents per make and year of the car

Description
In this project, we need to utilize data from an automobile tracking platform that tracks the history of important incidents after the initial sale of a new vehicle. Such incidents include subsequent private sales, repairs, and accident reports. The platform provides a good reference for second-hand buyers to understand the vehicles they are interested in.

A Mapreduce program needs to be developed to get the number of accident records per make and year of the car.
